# Currency_Converter

Want to see how much money would you have in another currency, but the only program you can access is a Java IDE? 
Don't worry - I've got you covered. 

## Usage

Just get the program to work and follow the instructions - put in the amount of money (program now supports only EUR) you want to convert, the currency you want to convert it to (you can choose from over 30 of those!) and let the program do its magic for you.
